;; Known bugs:
;;
;; - cw with a count doesn't work quite the same as Vim when the point
;;   is just before a space between words.
;;     - Fix plan: try cw with a count, then try dwi with a count; or
;;       ask on a relevant forum how the commands differ; or check
;;       how it works in vi/Vim, then check the Vim manual for more
;;       info; then, decide how to best fix it.
;;         - Vim's behavior seems inconsistent in this case.  I think
;;           it would be best to make the fix optional (defaulting to
;;           standard Vim behavior, though), as I (at least) like
;;           Vimpulse's behavior better in this case.
;;
;; - Undo has problems in XEmacs.
